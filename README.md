3. If you run npm install do not forget to create a .gitignore file to prevent the node_modules to be uploaded to GitHub:

2. Make sure that your website files are located in the main branch and in the root directory of the repository.
3. If your website is not already live, make sure that the index.html file is the main page of your website.
4. Click on the "Settings" tab in your repository.
5. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
6. In the "Source" dropdown menu, select the branch where your website files are located. For a simple website with only HTML and CSS, this is typically the main branch.
7. In the "Path" field, make sure that the root directory is specified (i.e., "/").
